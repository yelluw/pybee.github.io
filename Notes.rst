Notes
======

This file documents items that FOSSKit would tackle on the BeeWare website.


Brand
------

The brand message is currently confusing. Someone new to the project does not get a clear one sentence
explanation of what it does. The homepage copy should be updated to provide a clear brand message
that motivates visitors to learn more about the project. This itself would act as a better funnel entrance
for mailing list subscribers, contributors, sponsors, etc.


Documentation
-------------

The site is devoid of clear and actionable documentation for beginners.
It needs a short tutorial that walks the user through the process of building and packaging an app.


Steps to success
----------------

There are too many steps to complete any action.
For example, getting started with a project template requires 2 clicks and scrolling below the fold.
The amount of steps should be mostly limited to one and above the fold.


Copy
----

The copy is generally confusing.

(Copy is the content in the site.)
